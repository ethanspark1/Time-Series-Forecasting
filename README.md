# Time-Series-Forecasting
This was a school project to forecast sales tax data for a Texas county.
I was tasked with choosing a county in Texas and then forecasting that county's sales tax data.

The data has two different sheets. The first sheet contains the sales tax data for a few different counties in Texas.
The second sheet includes an alcohol sales and employment number for the Lubbock county, which is the county I chose to analyze. 

There are five different forecast methods in the in the Rcode. The five forecasts are: an ETS forecast, a seasonal ARIMA forecast, a One-Step-Ahead ETS, a One-Step-Ahead ARIMA, and a Var forecast with two suplimental variables. 
For each type of forecast, I had R chose the best model appropriate to use.
